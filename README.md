# LIRI Bot

README

Thank you for visiting my repository. This project uses Node.js, NPM, and APIs to create dynamic command line interface (CLI) responses. 

Here’s how it works:

    Calls are made to the following APIs in response to commands entered in the CLI:
    	Spotify (for music)
    	Bands in Town (for concerts)
    	OMDB (for movies)

    LIRI command can be entered two ways (1) in the CLI or (2)in the "random.txt" file:
    	To search Spotify enter: node liri.js spotify-this-song 'song name'
    	To search Bands in Town: node liri.js concert-this 'artist name'
    	To search OMDB: node liri.js movie-this 'movie name'
    	To search using the "random.txt" file: node liri.js do-what-it-says
    
LIRI will display resuts for each of the searches in the console.  Results are also logged in a file named log.txt.
    
This project is for everyone.

Enjoy!
